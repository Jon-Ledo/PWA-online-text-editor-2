## Description
Given a pre-existing text editor app, the code in this application aims to make it into a PWA, allowing a user to download to their desktop and having a functional app when not connected to the internet. Suggested uses would be to store some helpful code snippets.

Benefits of making an app into a PWA (Progressive Web App):
1. Availability in the offline mode
2. Mobile-like behavior
3. Smooth installation directly on a users device
4. No app store submission
5. Use of hardware features
